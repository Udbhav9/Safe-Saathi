Welcome to SafeSaath!
SafeSaath ensures your safety and justice through technological solutions and community empowerment. 
Our website is designed to ensure women's safety, legal empowerment, and community support, addressing the unique challenges faced by women in North-Eastern India.

Our prototype will function on the basis of 4 core features:

1. Alert & Sonic Shield System
In extreme cases (Red), it sends an SOS with live location and emergency details.
For potential threats (Orange), it alerts trusted contacts.
At low risk (Yellow), it provides safety tools, and when safe (Green), it tracks location without alerts unless triggered

2. Virtual Legal Desk
Combination of legal support and real-time safety information.
It allows users to file police complaints or legal notices directly through the app, either independently or with help from a virtual assistant.
Users can track the status of their complaints and legal cases, with real-time updates

3. Legal & Safety AI Companion
Offers users real-time, AI-driven chatbot assistance for legal and safety needs.
Users can ask legal questions in everyday language and receive actionable steps in return.
The system provides advice on laws, rights, and filing complaints, with support available in regional languages

4. Anonymized Reporting
Allows users to report crimes or incidents without revealing their identity.
It offers an anonymous reporting option that routes reports directly to NGOs, police, or community leaders for prompt action
